## How to run it locally


Clone this repository on your favorite local folder
````
git clone https://github.com/discombobulateme/saucebotgame.git
````

It runs on browser, but you need a localhost. The easies way, if you are using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), you can get [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) package and ***Go Live*** to open it on a localhost.
